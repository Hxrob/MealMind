# MealMind
# **This project aims to create a web-based application that generates personalized weekly meal plans based on user inputs. Users will provide parameters such as food preferences, allergies, weight, height, weight goals (e.g., gain or lose weight), and any relevant health issues. The application will use AI algorithms to process these inputs and generate a customized meal plan that meets their specific dietary and health requirements. The interface will be simple and intuitive, allowing users to easily input their data and view their meal plans. The AI will operate in the background, automatically tailoring the recommendations to the user's needs.**
